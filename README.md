# InningsPerGame_Estimator
Neural Network used to estimate Innings per Game by starters
based off coursera project

Goal of the project was to use statitics that quickly normalize to estimate SIERA accurately over as short of a period as possible.

SIERA is currently the best available true ERA reflector so it was chosen as the target.

Inputs were:

-Pitch selection by % (FB%, SL%, CT%, CB%, CH%, SF%, KN%, XX%)

-Pitch velocities (FBv, SLv, CTv, CBv, CHv, SFv, KNv)

-Contact%

-O-Swing%

-Z-Swing%

-Zone%


NN was organized as follows:

Layer 1 (Input): 19x100

Layer 2 (Dense, relu): 100x100

Layer 3 (Dense, relu): 100x50

Layer 4 (Dense, relu, Output): 50x1


RMSE for Test between 0.42 - 0.45


DATA - All data was taken from Fangraphs.com:

Pitcher season values 2002-2018 with minimum 30IP

- 5477 data points (4500 training set, 977 test set. 82/18 split)

- Learning rate set at 0.0001


TODO:

- Try SwStr instead of Contact

- Try to split Contact into O-contact, Z-Contact

- Add option to export NN for permanance
